# Build Artifacts Reference (`dist/assets`)

## Overview
The `dist/assets` directory contains the compiled and optimized assets for the production build of the application. These files are automatically generated by the build tool (Vite) when you run the build command (e.g., `npm run build`).

## File Types

### JavaScript Files (`.js`)
These files contain the bundled JavaScript code for the application.
- **Bundling**: Multiple source files are combined to reduce the number of HTTP requests.
- **Minification**: The code is compressed (whitespace removed, variables shortened) to reduce file size and improve load times.
- **Code Splitting**: You may see multiple `.js` files (chunks). This allows the browser to load only the code needed for the current page, improving performance.

### CSS Files (`.css`)
These files contain the compiled stylesheets.
- Like the JavaScript files, these are minified and bundled.

## File Naming Convention (Hashing)
You will notice filenames like `index-BnH-4VR6.js`.
- The random string (e.g., `-BnH-4VR6`) is a **content hash**.
- **Purpose**: This ensures **cache busting**. When the file content changes, the hash changes. This forces the user's browser to download the new version of the file instead of using an old cached version.

## Usage
- **Do NOT Edit**: You should never manually edit files in this directory. Any changes will be overwritten the next time you build the project.
- **Source of Truth**: Always make your changes in the `src` directory.
- **Deployment**: These are the files that get uploaded to the web server when you deploy your application.
