# Project Overview

## Executive Summary
**The Anonymous Wall** is a modern, privacy-focused social platform designed to foster open and honest communication. It provides a safe space for users to share their thoughts, feelings, and experiences without the pressure of revealing their identity.

The application features two main modes of interaction:
1.  **The Freedom Wall**: A visual grid of short, card-based messages ("confessions") with customizable themes and moods.
2.  **The Forum**: A structured discussion board for deeper conversations, organized by topics.

Built with **React 19** and **Firebase**, the platform ensures real-time interactivity, secure authentication, and robust content moderation.
