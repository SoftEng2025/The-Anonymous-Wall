# Future Roadmap

## Short-Term Goals (Q1 2026)
- **Mobile Application**: Wrap the web app using **Capacitor** or **React Native** to publish on Google Play Store.
- **Push Notifications**: Implement Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to notify users when someone replies to their post.
- **Image Support**: Allow users to upload images to the Forum (using Firebase Storage) with strict moderation.

## Medium-Term Goals (Q2 2026)
- **AI Moderation**: Integrate OpenAI API or TensorFlow.js to automatically flag toxic content before it's posted.
- **Private Messaging**: Allow users to start one-on-one anonymous chats.
- **Gamification**: Introduce badges and reputation points for helpful community members.

## Long-Term Vision
- **University Integration**: Partner with universities to create verified, campus-specific boards (e.g., "University of X Freedom Wall").
- **Mental Health Resources**: Integrate direct links to professional counseling services for users flagging distress.
